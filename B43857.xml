            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE see daily the Horrid Barbarous Designs of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> against those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though of the nearest Affinity; And finding themselves frustrated of all future hopes in performing their most Villanous and Unchristian Intentions, by a General Massacre (as it will appear by this) are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, rather than fail, to commit Murther upon all those who shall any ways obstruct their Dark and Horrid Inclinations, as will appear by the sequel of this Story,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Rowland</hi> of the Parish of <hi>Hexham</hi> in the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> being a Person well known for his honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to support the Protestant Religion, upon the Noise of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, knowing the Lord <hi>Derwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> and some others, (living not far from the Town of <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>) to be Papists, and that they would obstruct what in them lay the Protestant Interest, he imediately endeavoured to raise a sufficient Number of Protestants, whereby they might Disarm the Papist<hi>'s</hi> Houses of Arms, to prevent the Mischief they might do; which he did to the utmost of his power; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:211678:3"/>knowing their implacable Malice would tend to the taking away his Life, and having some other occasions, took his Journey for <hi>London,</hi> where he now is, and hath since his Arrival here recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter from <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Rowland</hi> his Brothers, now at <hi>Hexham,</hi> that <hi>William Rowland</hi> their Kinsman was Drinking at a Gardner's House at <hi>Dalston</hi> with <hi>George Hog</hi> and a Boy, and coming homeward, <hi>William Rowland</hi> would of necessity call upon a Friend that he had which lived at the Lord <hi>Derwinwaters,</hi> and thereupon knocked at the Gate, upon which, Mr. <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> the Lord's Son, looked out of the House, and Asked who was there? And he Answer'd, he was <hi>William Rowland</hi> of <hi>Hexham,</hi> whereupon Mr. <hi>Thomas Ratcliff</hi> commanded his Servants to break his Neck over the Rock, and thought it to be <hi>William Rowland</hi> now in <hi>London,</hi> with this expression, hast thou got from <hi>London</hi> already thou Rogue? Upon which Four of them came out and threw him over the Rock, at the West End of the Bowling Alley, about Four Yards high, and if a Tree had not been, they had thrown him into the DEVIL's-WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, the Man that was with him, and Boy, was got to the Bridg that goes into the Park, and seeing my Lords Men throw him over the Rock, cryed out, you have Killed the Man, take him to your charge, I will go and raise the Town of <hi>Hexham,</hi> and Ring the <hi>FRA-BELL,</hi> upon which Four of them follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>George Hog</hi> and the Boy, and brought them up where <hi>William Rowland</hi> was lying; and they said to <hi>Hog,</hi> thou hast Killed this Man; and if he had been Dead, they would have either Killed <hi>Hog</hi> and the Boy, or Sworn his Death upon <hi>Hog;</hi> he was so Bruised and Wounded, that he is in small hopes of Recovery. He was carried back to <hi>Dilston,</hi> where he now lieth in a most Deplorable Condition. Such you see are the most moderate Cruelties of the Papists, in the Execution of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, and the Tenets of their Religion; from which <hi>Libera Nos Domine.</hi>
